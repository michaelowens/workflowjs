# WorkflowJS

Workflow engine written in pure JavaScript.

To get started, all you need to do is install the dependencies and serve the files:

Now serve the folder:

```shell
$ npm install
$ npx http-server
```

# Development

It's highly recommended to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for the best experience. Install the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) plugin and open a connection. This will now have live reloading enabled by default. VSCode will now give many benefits of typescript with intellisense, without actually having to use typescript in our project.
